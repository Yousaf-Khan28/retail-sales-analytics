## Retail Sales Analysis — Discount Strategy Impact

### Overview
This project analyses how discounting affects sales and profitability using a real-world retail dataset.

### Key Insights
- Technology is the most profitable category
- Profit declines as discount increases
- Losses begin around 25–30% discount levels
- Furniture becomes unprofitable earlier than other categories
- Discounts do not significantly increase revenue

### Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

### Business Recommendation
Reduce heavy discounting strategies, especially above 25%, as they erode profit without delivering sufficient sales growth.
